PICCIALLI Patrizia - Presidente - Dott. PEZZELLA Vincenzo - Consigliere - Dott. D'ANDREA Alessadro - Consigliere - Dott. MICCICHE'Loredana - rel. Consigliere - Dott.

            "SENTENZA sul ricorso proposto da:  H.M. nato il (Omissis); avverso la sentenza del 12/04/2022 della CORTE APPELLO di ANCONA visti gli atti, il provvedimento impugnato e il ricorso; udita la relazione svolta dal Consigliere LOREDANA MICCICHE'; lette le conclusioni Pubblico Ministero, in persona del Sostituto Procuratore ASSUNTA COCOMELLO; lette le conclusioni dell'avv. Emilio Perfetti per la parte civile Associazione Italiana familiari e vittime della strada.\n",
            "RITENUTO IN FATTO 1. La Corte d'Appello di Ancona, con sentenza in data 12 aprile 2022, confermava la sentenza del GUP presso il Tribunale Urbino di condanna di h.m. quale responsabile del reato di omicidio colposo ai danni di F.C., deceduto in un sinistro stradale, anche relativamente alle statuizioni civili e lo condannava al pagamento delle spese sostenute dalle parti civili per il giudizio di appello.  All'imputato era stata contestata una colpa generica e la violazione dell'art. 141 C.d.S. poiché alla guida della sua autovettura, nel percorrere la strada provinciale n. (Omissis), alla guida dell'autocarro (Omissis), aveva tenuto una velocità non adeguata e comunque pari a 80 Km/h non commisurata allo stato dei luoghi, in considerazione delle condizioni metereologiche e dell'ora serale, e, affrontando un tratto di strada curvilineo, aveva perso il controllo del veicolo che, capovolgendosi, rovinava contro un manufatto, così cagionando la morte per gravissimo trauma cranico del F.C., seduto al lato passeggero anteriore.  La Corte territoriale, nel respingere i motivi di gravame, riteneva esaustiva la motivazione della sentenza di prime cure in ordine alle modalità del sinistro, su cui si soffermava rispondendo alle osservazioni mosse dall'appellante; confermava la statuizione del primo giudice in ordine al mancato riconoscimento delle circostanze attenuanti generiche, la durata della sanzione amministrativa accessoria e l'ammontare delle spese liquidate dal Tribunale in favore delle parti civili.  2. Avverso tale pronuncia ha proposto ricorso l'imputato, a mezzo del difensore di fiducia, per tre distinti motivi.  2.1. Con un primo motivo lamenta vizio di mancanza della motivazione in ordine alla ricostruzione della dinamica del sinistro, non essendo illustrate le ragioni per cui la Corte territoriale aveva deciso di disattendere le risultanze della consulenza tecnica di parte, puntualmente illustrate negli specifici motivi di appello.  La sentenza impugnata risultava priva dei passaggi logici ed argomentativi indispensabili, essendosi limitata al mero richiamo delle considerazioni svolte dal giudice di primo grado, tacendo del tutto le ragioni per le quali erano stati ritenuti inattendibili le fonti di prova a discarico dell'imputato.  2.1. Con un secondo motivo deduce vizio di motivazione in ordine al diniego delle attenuanti generiche.  La motivazione offerta dalla Corte non aveva tenuto conto delle pur enunciate condizioni soggettive dell'imputato ed aveva illogicamente valutato, in senso sfavorevole, il comportamento post factum dell'imputato medesimo.  2.3. Con un terzo motivo infine lamenta vizio di motivazione in ordine all'applicazione della sanzione amministrativa accessoria di cui all'art. 222 cds (sospensione della patente di guida) nella misura massima.  La sentenza impugnata non aveva assolto l'obbligo motivazionale in ordine ai criteri di valutazione imposti dall'art. 218 cds (entità del danno, gravità della violazione commessa, pericolo per il futuro uso di automezzi), tralasciando di considerare circostanze rilevanti quali la velocità non eccessiva, la piena efficienza psico fisica dell'imputato, il fatto che quest'ultimo era rientrato in possesso della patente da circa sei anni, senza più aver commesso infrazioni al codice della strada.  3. Il Procuratore Generale, con requisitoria scritta, ha concluso per il rigetto del ricorso.  La parte civile Associazione familiari e vittime della strada ha depositato conclusioni scritte in cui ha insistito per il rigetto del ricorso.\n",
            "CONSIDERATO IN DIRITTO 1. Il ricorso non è fondato.  2. Con il primo motivo si contesta l'affermazione di responsabilità, alla quale la Corte territoriale era pervenuta senza valutare la ricostruzione alternativa operata dall'imputato in ordine alla dinamica del sinistro.  Il motivo è privo di pregio.  Va innanzi tutto ricordato che si verte in ipotesi di \"doppia conforme\", ove l'obbligo motivazionale gravante sul giudice di secondo grado è meno stringente, dovendosi fare riferimento ad un complesso motivazionale coerente ed organico, rappresentato da entrambe le sentenze.  E va altresì rimarcato che il principio secondo cui la condanna può essere pronunciata solo se l'imputato risulti colpevole \"oltre ogni ragionevole dubbio\", non può essere utilizzato, nel giudizio di legittimità, per valorizzare e rendere decisiva una ricostruzione alternativa del fatto emersa in sede di merito su segnalazione della difesa, se tale differente prospettazione sia stata oggetto di puntuale e motivata disamina da parte del giudice, il quale abbia individuato gli elementi di conferma dell'ipotesi ricostruttiva accolta posti a base della condanna, in modo da far risultare la non razionalità del dubbio derivante dalla prospettazione alternativa, non potendo detto dubbio fondarsi su un'ipotesi del tutto congetturale, seppure plausibile (Sez.1, n. 53512 del 17 luglio 2014, Rv.261600; Sez.4, n. 22257 del 25 marzo 2014, Rv.259204).  2.1 Ciò posto, si osserva che all'esito dell'istruttoria - ripercorsa in maniera dettagliata ed esaustiva nella impugnata sentenza, così come anche in quella di primo grado - si è pervenuti ad una precisa ricostruzione della dinamica del sinistro così descritta: l'imputato aveva volontariamente assunto la guida del mezzo, chiedendo espressamente le chiavi, essendo consapevole del fatto che si trattasse di un veicolo a trazione posteriore/integrale; le copiose precipitazioni avevano reso l'asfalto scivoloso e con aderenza limitata; l'imputato aveva affrontato, su strada extraurbana, una curva destrorsa in leggera salita; la velocità, pari a 70/80 km/h, non era commisurata alle condizioni di tempo e luogo; il conducente aveva dunque perso il controllo del veicolo che, a causa di una sovra sterzata, si dirigeva verso il margine destro della strada e impattava contro un manufatto, con conseguente ribaltamento del mezzo e conseguenze letali per il passeggero.  Quanto alla responsabilità del sinistro, rispondendo in ordine ai rilievi sollevati nell'atto di appello, fondati su una diversa ricostruzione - operata dal perito di parte - in ordine alla diversa, inferiore, velocità del veicolo, la Corte territoriale ha osservato che la violazione della regola cautelare specifica di cui all'art. 141 cds, e cioè quella di adeguare la condotta di guida e la velocità allo stato dei luoghi,alle caratteristiche del veicolo e d'ogni altra circostanza, non era stata palesemente rispettata dall'imputato, che ben conosceva le caratteristiche del mezzo (a trazione posteriore), con i conseguenti rischi della tipologia del mezzo stesso nel sostenere le manovre in curva (ossia il cd \" sovrasterzo\", vale a dire lo sbandamento che porta l'auto a trazione posteriore a stringere troppo la curva).  Rileva la sentenza impugnata, con passaggio motivazionale immune da vizi logici ed aderente alle risultanze istruttorie, come sia stato lo stesso consulente di parte incaricato dall'imputato a riconoscere che quest'ultimo era verosimilmente privo di cognizione circa le modalità di guida di quella particolare tipologia di veicolo e delle delicate manovre che avrebbe dovuto porre in atto in caso di \" sovrasterzo\".  Conclude quindi la Corte territoriale che le modalità di guida nell'impegnare la curva non fossero adeguate alle reali capacità dell'imputato di fronteggiare la manovra di emergenza.  2.2 Si tratta, come esposto, di una ricostruzione in fatto ampia ed accurata, non sindacabile in sede di legittimità, perché sorretta da motivazione immune da vizi logici e giuridici, che lungi dal recepire acriticamente e pedissequamente le conclusioni dei periti del PM, ha tenuto conto dei rilievi del consulente di parte, disattendendoli con ragionata valutazione.  Non sussiste dunque il vizio di motivazione denunciato dal ricorrente.  3. Anche il secondo motivo non è fondato.  La prospettata censura non tiene conto della esaustiva motivazione della sentenza impugnata, immune di vizi logici, che ha escluso l'applicabilità delle circostanze attenuanti generiche in ragione della condotta dell'imputato che, immediatamente dopo il sinistro, aveva spostato il corpo senza vita della vittima nel tentativo di addossare al defunto la responsabilità dell'incidente, insistendo più volte nella falsa ricostruzione dei fatti fino alla inevitabile ritrattazione.  Sottolinea la Corte gli elementi costituiti dalla giovane età dell'imputato e dalla sua situazione socio economica non valgono ed elidere la assoluta gravità del predetto comportamento che.tratteggia una negativa personalità del reo, intervenuto consapevolmente sul corpo dell'amico ormai privo di vita, alterando lo stato dei luoghi ed insistendo ripetutamente sulla falsa versione dei fatti.  Va allora rammentato che ai fini della concessione o del diniego delle circostanze attenuanti generiche è sufficiente che il giudice di merito prenda in esame, tra gli elementi indicati dall'art. 133 c.p., quello (o quelli) che ritiene prevalente e atto a consigliare o meno la concessione del beneficio; e il relativo apprezzamento discrezionale, laddove supportato da una motivazione idonea a far emergere in misura sufficiente il pensiero dello stesso giudice circa l'adeguamento della pena concreta alla gravità effettiva del reato ed alla personalità del reo, non è censurabile in sede di legittimità se congruamente motivato (ex multis Sez. 5, n. 43952 del 13/04/2017, Rv. 271269; Sez. 3, n. 2233 del 17/06/2021, Rv. 282693).  4. L'ultimo motivo attiene alla determinazione della durata della sanzione accessoria della sospensione della patente di guida.  Anche detto motivo è infondato.  La corte territoriale ha esaustivamente argomentato in ordine a tutti i parametri di cui all'art. 218 cds (gravità del danno apportato, gravità della violazione commessa, pericolo che l'ulteriore circolazione dell'imputato può cagionare) richiamando la tragicità dell'evento e la gravità dell'imprudenza commessa, consistita nell'essersi consapevolmente messo alla guida di un mezzo di cui non si conosceva appieno la dinamica di funzionamento in caso di manovre di emergenza.  Si tratta di motivazione ampia, esaustiva, coerente con le risultanze processuali e totalmente immune da vizi logici.  5. Alla luce delle esposte considerazioni, il ricorso deve essere rigettato ed il ricorrente va condannato al pagamento delle spese processuali nonché alla refusione delle spese sostenute dalla parte civile Associazione italiana familiari e vittime della strada, liquidate come da dispositivo.\n",
            "P.Q.M. Rigetta il ricorso e condanna il ricorrente al pagamento delle spese processuali nonché alla rifusione delle spese sostenute dalla parte civile Associazione italiana familiari e vittime della strada che liquida in Euro 3.000,00 oltre accessori come per legge.

        "### 1. **Fact Consistency Checks**\n",
        "- **Extract Key Information**: Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract key entities (names, dates, places) from both the original text and the summary. Compare them to check if the summary accurately represents crucial facts from the original text.\n",

        "### 2. **Semantic Similarity**\n",
        "- **Cosine Similarity**: Compute the cosine similarity between the vector representations of the original text and the summary. High cosine similarity indicates that the summary retains the core meaning of the original text.\n",
        "- **BERT-based Similarity**: Use models like Sentence-BERT to encode both texts and summaries into embeddings, then calculate cosine similarity.\n",
        "\n",

            "* 1. Il ricorso non è fondato.   2. Con il primo motivo si contesta l'affermazione di responsabilità, alla quale la Corte territoriale era pervenuta senza valutare la ricostruzione alternativa operata dall'imputato in ordine alla dinamica del sinistro.   Il motivo è privo di pregio.   Va innanzi tutto ricordato che si verte in ipotesi di \"doppia conforme\", ove l'obbligo motivazionale gravante sul giudice di secondo grado è meno stringente, dovendosi fare riferimento ad un complesso motivazionale coerente ed organico, rappresentato da entrambe le sentenze.   E va altresì rimarcato che il principio secondo cui la condanna può essere pronunciata solo se l'imputato risulti colpevole \"oltre ogni ragionevole dubbio\", non può essere utilizzato, nel giudizio di legittimità, per valorizzare e rendere decisiva una ricostruzione alternativa del fatto emersa in sede di merito su segnalazione della difesa, se tale differente prospettazione sia stata oggetto di puntuale e motivata disamina da parte del giudice, il quale abbia individuato gli elementi di conferma dell'ipotesi ricostruttiva accolta posti a base della condanna, in modo da far risultare la non razionalità del dubbio derivante dalla prospettazione alternativa, non potendo detto dubbio fondarsi su un'ipotesi del tutto congetturale, seppure plausibile (Sez.1, n. 53512 del 17 luglio 2014, Rv.261600; Sez.4, n. 22257 del 25 marzo 2014, Rv.259204).   2.1 Ciò posto, si osserva che all'esito dell'istruttoria - ripercorsa in maniera dettagliata ed esaustiva nella impugnata sentenza, così come anche in quella di primo grado - si è pervenuti ad una precisa ricostruzione della dinamica del sinistro così descritta: l'imputato aveva volontariamente assunto la guida del mezzo, chiedendo espressamente le chiavi, essendo consapevole del fatto che si trattasse di un veicolo a trazione posteriore/integrale; le copiose precipitazioni avevano reso l'asfalto scivoloso e con aderenza limitata; l'imputato aveva affrontato, su strada extraurbana, una curva destrorsa in leggera salita; la velocità, pari a 70/80 km/h, non era commisurata alle condizioni di tempo e luogo; il conducente aveva dunque perso il controllo del veicolo che, a causa di una sovra sterzata, si dirigeva verso il margine destro della strada e impattava contro un manufatto, con conseguente ribaltamento del mezzo e conseguenze letali per il passeggero.   Quanto alla responsabilità del sinistro, rispondendo in ordine ai rilievi sollevati nell'atto di appello, fondati su una diversa ricostruzione - operata dal perito di parte - in ordine alla diversa, inferiore, velocità del veicolo, la Corte territoriale ha osservato che la violazione della regola cautelare specifica di cui all'art. 141 cds, e cioè quella di adeguare la condotta di guida e la velocità allo stato dei luoghi,alle caratteristiche del veicolo e d'ogni altra circostanza, non era stata palesemente rispettata dall'imputato, che ben conosceva le caratteristiche del mezzo (a trazione posteriore), con i conseguenti rischi della tipologia del mezzo stesso nel sostenere le manovre in curva (ossia il cd \" sovrasterzo\", vale a dire lo sbandamento che porta l'auto a trazione posteriore a stringere troppo la curva).   Rileva la sentenza impugnata, con passaggio motivazionale immune da vizi logici ed aderente alle risultanze istruttorie, come sia stato lo stesso consulente di parte incaricato dall'imputato a riconoscere che quest'ultimo era verosimilmente privo di cognizione circa le modalità di guida di quella particolare tipologia di veicolo e delle delicate manovre che avrebbe dovuto porre in atto in caso di \" sovrasterzo\".   Conclude quindi la Corte territoriale che le modalità di guida nell'impegnare la curva non fossero adeguate alle reali capacità dell'imputato di fronteggiare la manovra di emergenza.   2.2 Si tratta, come esposto, di una ricostruzione in fatto ampia ed accurata, non sindacabile in sede di legittimità, perché sorretta da motivazione immune da vizi logici e giuridici, che lungi dal recepire acriticamente e pedissequamente le conclusioni dei periti del PM, ha tenuto conto dei rilievi del consulente di parte, disattendendoli con ragionata valutazione.   Non sussiste dunque il vizio di motivazione denunciato dal ricorrente.   3. Anche il secondo motivo non è fondato.   La prospettata censura non tiene conto della esaustiva motivazione della sentenza impugnata, immune di vizi logici, che ha escluso l'applicabilità delle circostanze attenuanti generiche in ragione della condotta dell'imputato che, immediatamente dopo il sinistro, aveva spostato il corpo senza vita della vittima nel tentativo di addossare al defunto la responsabilità dell'incidente, insistendo più volte nella falsa ricostruzione dei fatti fino alla inevitabile ritrattazione.   Sottolinea la Corte gli elementi costituiti dalla giovane età dell'imputato e dalla sua situazione socio economica non valgono ed elidere la assoluta gravità del predetto comportamento che.tratteggia una negativa personalità del reo, intervenuto consapevolmente sul corpo dell'amico ormai privo di vita, alterando lo stato dei luoghi ed insistendo ripetutamente sulla falsa versione dei fatti.   Va allora rammentato che ai fini della concessione o del diniego delle circostanze attenuanti generiche è sufficiente che il giudice di merito prenda in esame, tra gli elementi indicati dall'art. 133 c.p., quello (o quelli) che ritiene prevalente e atto a consigliare o meno la concessione del beneficio; e il relativo apprezzamento discrezionale, laddove supportato da una motivazione idonea a far emergere in misura sufficiente il pensiero dello stesso giudice circa l'adeguamento della pena concreta alla gravità effettiva del reato ed alla personalità del reo, non è censurabile in sede di legittimità se congruamente motivato (ex multis Sez. 5, n. 43952 del 13/04/2017, Rv. 271269; Sez. 3, n. 2233 del 17/06/2021, Rv. 282693).   4. L'ultimo motivo attiene alla determinazione della durata della sanzione accessoria della sospensione della patente di guida.   Anche detto motivo è infondato.   La corte territoriale ha esaustivamente argomentato in ordine a tutti i parametri di cui all'art. 218 cds (gravità del danno apportato, gravità della violazione commessa, pericolo che l'ulteriore circolazione dell'imputato può cagionare) richiamando la tragicità dell'evento e la gravità dell'imprudenza commessa, consistita nell'essersi consapevolmente messo alla guida di un mezzo di cui non si conosceva appieno la dinamica di funzionamento in caso di manovre di emergenza.   Si tratta di motivazione ampia, esaustiva, coerente con le risultanze processuali e totalmente immune da vizi logici.   5. Alla luce delle esposte considerazioni, il ricorso deve essere rigettato ed il ricorrente va condannato al pagamento delle spese processuali nonché alla refusione delle spese sostenute dalla parte civile Associazione italiana familiari e vittime della strada, liquidate come da dispositivo.\n"
